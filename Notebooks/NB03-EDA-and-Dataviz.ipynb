    "However, my anecdotal observation as a watcher of college gymnastics is that the judges in this competition are fairly lenient; hesitancy on beam or short handstands on bars might not incur the deduction they would in other leagues. However, they are quite strict on landings - that is, if a gymnast doesn't perfectly stick their landing, they will incur a deduction. Given vault's landing difficulty, does this even out the advantage of having to perform fewer skills?"
