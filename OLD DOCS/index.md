#About me: 

Who are you and why did you create this project (“I am a Econ student from XXXX and I created this project as part of the LSE Summer School ME204 course (2024)” should suffice, for example)
#The Data: 

What data source did you choose? Why did you choose it? How did you collect it? What was challenging about it?

#Key Findings: 

What are the main insights you gained from your data? What are the most interesting things you found? Something like “Once I cleaned up the data by doing X, Y and Z, I found that the price of bread in the UK has increased by 20% in the last 5 years while the price of milk has remained stable, as shown in the plot below” would be a good example.

#Future: 
What would you do next if you had more time? What other questions could you ask of this data? What other data sources could you use to complement this data?
